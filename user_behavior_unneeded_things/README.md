### 📱 Mobile App User Behavior Analysis  

**Project Description:**  
The ambitious team behind the “Unneeded Things” service is looking for mobile app analysts! The client is a product manager focused on improving user engagement in our mobile application. To enhance these metrics, we analyzed user behavior in the app:  

- 🔍 **Examined** the relationship between the contact view event and other user actions. Identified common scenarios leading to contact views.  
- 📈 **Evaluated** which actions are most frequently performed by users who view contacts.  
- 🧪 **Performed** statistical hypothesis testing to determine factors influencing the likelihood of a user reaching the contact view stage and making a call.  
- 🗺️ **Analyzed** user journeys and product metrics to assess feature effectiveness and identify behavioral patterns.  

**Outcome:** ✅ Discovered that user actions like clicking on recommendations and adding to favorites have a statistically significant impact on conversion to contact views. This allowed me to propose a more precise user segmentation for personalized marketing campaigns.  

📊 **Tools used:** Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebook
